<p>Getting banned from Warframe can be a major bummer, especially if you’re sure it was a misunderstanding or just bad timing. This handy guide will walk you through what to do if your account got the boot and how to file an appeal with the best shot at getting back into the Origin System.</p>
<h2 id="maybe-you-are-hwid-banned-">Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️</h2>
<p>Did you get kicked out right after making a fresh account, or is the ban stalking you across every new username? You might have been <strong>HWID banned</strong> (Hardware ID Ban)! This means Warframe’s system has blacklisted your PC hardware, which makes jumping back in a real challenge — even with brand new accounts.</p>
