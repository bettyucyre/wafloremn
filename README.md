# How to Get Unbanned on Warframe (2025 Guide) 🚀

Getting banned from Warframe can be a major bummer, especially if you’re sure it was a misunderstanding or just bad timing. This handy guide will walk you through what to do if your account got the boot and how to file an appeal with the best shot at getting back into the Origin System.

## Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️

Did you get kicked out right after making a fresh account, or is the ban stalking you across every new username? You might have been **HWID banned** (Hardware ID Ban)! This means Warframe’s system has blacklisted your PC hardware, which makes jumping back in a real challenge — even with brand new accounts.

An HWID spoofer might be your secret weapon if you’ve got a hardware ban and want to play again.

## Step 1: Understand Why You Were Banned ❓

Check any emails or pop-ups from Digital Extremes or Warframe to find out why they hit the ban hammer. Common ban reasons include:
- Using cheats, hacks, or third-party mods that break the rules
- Being toxic, harassing other players, or spamming chat
- Sharing your account or suspicious login activity  

**Pro tip:** Skim through the Warframe Terms of Service before shooting off your appeal.

## Step 2: Collect Your Information 📝

Before you send a distress flare to Support, have these ready:
- Your Warframe account email address  
- Your Warframe username or alias  
- When your account was banned (date/time)  
- Any screenshots or error messages you received
